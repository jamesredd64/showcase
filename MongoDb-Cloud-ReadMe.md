# MongoDB Atlas Free Tier (M0) Limitations

✅ Cluster Size: Limited to 512MB of storage ✅ Regions: Only available in select AWS, GCP, and Azure regions ✅ Max Connections: 500 concurrent connections ✅ Max Collections: 500 collections per cluster ✅ Max Databases: 100 databases per cluster ✅ CRUD Operations: 100 read/write requests per second ✅ Replication: 3-node replica set (cannot modify replication settings) ✅ No Backups: Automated backups are not available (must use mongodump manually) ✅ No Sharding: Cannot deploy sharded clusters ✅ No Private Networking: No VPC peering or private endpoints ✅ No Custom Encryption: Cannot use customer-managed encryption keys

🛠 What This Means for You
Great for development & testing, but not ideal for production if you need high performance.

If your app grows beyond 100 CRUD requests per second, you may need to upgrade to a paid tier.

You must manually back up your data since automated backups are unavailable.

You can find more details in MongoDB's official Atlas Free Tier documentation. 🚀 Would you like help choosing an upgrade path if needed? 🔍🔥
